- Maven
- Browser Drivers (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/muhammedkeskin/enuygun2`
2. Install dependencies: `mvn clean install`

## Running Tests

1. Open the terminal/command prompt in the project directory.

## Project Structure

The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better organization and maintainability of test code. It includes the following packages:

- `pages`: Contains Page Object classes that define web element locators on pages.
- `runners`: Contains Cucumber runner classes (`CukesRunner` and `FailedTestRunner`) to execute the feature files.
- `step_definitions`: Contains Cucumber step definition classes that map the Gherkin steps to Java methods.
- `steps`: Contains methods that implement the test steps.
- `utils`: Contains utility classes for page utils, configuration reading, and Driver(WebDriver setup).

## Configuration

Browser configuration and other settings can be customized in the `configuration.properties`.

## Reporting

Test reports are generated using the default Cucumber HTML report plugin. After running tests, the report can be found at `target/enuygun-html-reports.html`.

## Notes

- Please make sure to have the appropriate browser drivers (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) installed and added to the system's PATH.
- You can modify the scenario or add new ones as needed in the feature files located in the `src/test/resources` directory.
